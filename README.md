# SonosUSBhub

This is my private USB charging station in the kitchen. I save myself a power strip and numerous USB chargers for my devices, such as smartphone, tablet, camera and everything else that is loaded via USB.

Because we only had one socket in the kitchen corner, I decided to expand the existing SONOS PLAY:1 and build this case.

If you have a similar problem, you can use and maybe even improve the print data and design data here.

The used USB charger has five powerful connectors and is available under different brand names. An example could be found here on Amazon (NO Affiliate Link):
